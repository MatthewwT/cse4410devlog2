                        <p class="lead"><br>After the introduction of the tutorial, we added the first room that the player
                        will experience.  This is where we added our first puzzle which was designed by one of our team members.
                        Each consecutive puzzle will be deisgned by each team member, and the puzzle ideas we have so far are 
                        as shown below.</p>

                        <p class="lead"><br>The first puzzle consists of three pictures of a 3x3 grid where each grid will be filled
                        with a different color.  The player will then have an empty grid in front of them and have to figure out 
                        how to complete the puzzle in order to unlock the next area or the next puzzle in the room. </p>

                        <p class="lead" style="padding-top: 100px">The second puzzle will deal with the periodic table. The player
                        will have to figure out using the elements and numbers of the periodic table to get a key word and type it
                        into the popup prompt. </p>
                            <img src="Periodictable.JPG" width=800px; height=450px alt="#">

                        <p class="lead" style="padding-top: 100px">The next puzzle (no image so far) will deal with NPC interaction and 
                        vials.  The player will have to bring a vial to the NPC, where the NPC will respond with a prompt based on the 
                        vials smell.  The player will have to place the vials in the correct sequence based on picture hints.  
                        For example, if the vial smells like flowers, the player will have to place it in front of a picture with flowers. </p>


                            <!-- <p class="lead" style="padding-top: 100px">After some more team discussion and brainstorming ideas,
                            we landed on some puzzle's we each would like to work on along with the theme of the video game.  
                            Using the puzzles as a guide, we each studied tutorials which closely followed our own puzzle design
                            and implemented it on unity on our own.  After some tinkering and debugging, we will push the result
                            of our tutorials onto the main branch of our github in order to combine them together and debug further.</p> -->

                        <h3><br>Movement - Matthew</h3>
                            <p class="lead">In this update, we have fixed the player sticking to walls. The issue with this was a checkbox in unity
                                for the physics which made the player able to stick to walls. </p>
                            <p class="lead">The future update will still need to implement a character sprite in order to begin character animations.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3><br>Scene Transition - Mauricio</h3>
                            <p class="lead">The updated scene transition is still a work in progress, but the vector work is coming along smoothly.</p>

                            <p class="lead">The issue was that the player model was not spawning correctly due to not having the vectors moving the player model.</p>
                            
                            <p class="lead">A study into why this was happening is in place and will be fully implemented before the demo of the live game.</p>
                            

                        <h3><br>Interactions - Peter/Antonio</h3>
                            <p class="lead">After going through some Unity tutorials for 2D platformers, we have a better idea on how to implement
                                interactions with NPC's and objects.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p class="lead">One approach is to use a box collider in Unity and code it to whenever the character touches the NPC,
                                the NPC will give them a prompt which will close whenever the player walks away. This apporach is easy to execute but 
                                is not esthetically pleasing.
                            </p>

                            <p class="lead">Another approach we came up with was to have the NPC as a background interactable object in which the player
                                can use their mouse to click on the NPC or have a popup dialog which the player can then press a button to interact with the NPC.
                            </p>
